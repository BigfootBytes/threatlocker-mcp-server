  - Updated @modelcontextprotocol/sdk to v1.26.0
- **Re-added SSE transport** for Claude Desktop compatibility
  - Uses SDK's `SSEServerTransport` class
  - `/sse` + `/messages` endpoints restored
  - Both transports now available on same server
- Added Origin header validation for DNS rebinding protection
- Added `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` environment variable for browser request allowlist
- Bumped version to 0.4.0, then 0.4.1, then 0.4.2

  - MCP request logging with method and tool name
  - Error logging for all transport failures

### Detailed Changes

- Updated MCP SDK from v1.0.0 to v1.26.0 for Streamable HTTP transport support
- Added createMcpServer factory function with Zod schemas for Streamable HTTP transport
- Implemented Streamable HTTP POST /mcp endpoint using StreamableHTTPServerTransport
- Added GET /mcp and DELETE /mcp handlers returning 405 (not supported in stateless mode)
- Removed legacy SSE transport code (SSESession, sseSessions Map, sendSSEEvent, handleMcpMessage, handleToolCall)
- Removed GET /sse and POST /messages endpoints
- Removed crypto import (no longer needed for session IDs)
- Inlined tool dispatch in REST API /tools/:name endpoint
- Updated startup console messages to reflect Streamable HTTP as primary transport
- Added Origin header validation for DNS rebinding protection on POST /mcp and POST /tools/:name endpoints
- Added whitespace trimming to ALLOWED_ORIGINS parsing for better config file handling
- Bumped version to 0.4.0 in package.json, http.ts, and index.ts for Streamable HTTP release
- Updated /health endpoint to report transport as 'streamable-http' and include protocolVersion '2025-03-26'

## 2026-02-03

- Built initial MCP server with 4 tools: computers, computer_groups, applications, policies
